# isAnagram - Algorithm Problem

A word is an anagram of another word if both use the same letters in the same quantity, but arranged differently. Write a function that checks if two provided strings are anagrams of each other; letter casing shouldnâ€™t matter. Also, consider only characters, not spaces or punctuation. For example:
```
isAnagram('finder', 'Friend')  --> true
isAnagram('hello', 'bye') --> false
```
